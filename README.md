# Benevis
Benevis - A Persian programming language.

# About

Benevis is a programming language that allows you to write code in Persian. The compiler for Benevis is written in Python and uses the RPLY library for lexing and parsing. Support is implemented for both Latinised (Pinglish) Farsi and Perso-Arabic Farsi, with new features being added in regularly.

## Getting Started

To start using Benevis, you need to have Python installed on your system. Benevis works with Python 3.9+.

### Installation

To install Benevis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/benevis.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd benevis
    ```

3. Install the package:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

### Usage

After installation, you can start Benevis with the following command:

```bash
benevis [filename]
```

If you require any help setting up, call
```bash
benevis -h
```

### Contributions

I am actively seeking to collaborate with fellow developers or linguists of the Persian language to really provide more expansive ranges of syntax for the language! If you're interested, contact me on LinkedIn or fork this project and drop me a message, let's try and put Farsi back on top!
